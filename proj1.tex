\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}

\item For concurrency exercise that reminds me some main knowledge related to CS344 such as how Interprocess Communications and synchronous worked in operating system.
Otherwise, this exercise also related to assembly language that is related what I have studied in CS271. But since that is been a long time with that class, those are 
almost new knowledge for me and that is a nice warm up with assembly language for next few assignments. However, there has another point for this exercise is to thinking
about parallel programming that is also why we have producer and consumer to process two queues of data. 

\item For approach this problem, from the introduction of this exercise, I could know my design is have to have two independently threads handler which are producer and consumer.
Each of those handler should handle producer threads and consumer threads separately which mean those threads are parallel. To be parallel that means threads working for producer that they
are only allowed process by producer, threads for consumers also only can process by consumers. Two queues of threads they do not have competition because they have privileges handler which are 
producer and consumer. To match the requirement, I would have to use multiple threads and mutex lock since the buffer only can hold 32 items. Also I should handle conditions, if consumer is want to 
have an item from buffer but the buffer is empty I should let consumer to be wait until the process gives an item to buffer. Otherwise, producer should wait when the buffer is full. In this situation, timing design 
is also important. The hardest part for design this program is to user assembly language to handle random values to distribute to producer. For end of the design, I still do not have any idea to handle that by using 
Mersenne Twister to handle it on os-class. For algorithm, for this project there is do not have any deeply algorithm to design and use. The only one is should be generate random values for the producer but I have not
figure it out.

\item For testing this program, I want to print out the random values generated from the assembly code, either the number and the waiting period. Also print out what value the producer send to buffer and what consumer received from the buffer. 
Also I should test when buffer is empty, does consumer can wait until there is something in the buffer. For testing producer, I would comment the consumer function that makes producer function never stop push items to the buffer
until that is full. If the producer can blocked until there has a space in the buffer.

\item I both reviewed the knowledge from CS344 and learn how to use mix of C programming language and assembly language. For using assembly language in this class is important since I feel like we study more about kernel we are more close to the hardware which requires me 
to know how to use assembly language to approach the bottom level programming.
